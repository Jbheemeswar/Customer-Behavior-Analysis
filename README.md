📊 Consumer Shopping Behavior – Data Analytics Project:

This project analyzes consumer shopping behavior to uncover trends that can help improve sales, customer satisfaction, and retention.
The workflow includes loading data in Python, performing EDA, cleaning data, running SQL queries, building a Power BI dashboard, and generating a final report & presentation.

📁 Dataset

Source: Retail consumer transactions dataset (CSV)

Contains information on:

Customer ID, Age, Gender

Transaction details

Product Category

Purchase Amount

Ratings & Reviews

Discounts & Payment Details

Purchase Channel (Online / Offline)

Objective: Understand what influences purchasing patterns and repeat-buying behavior.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Stage	Tools Used
Data Processing	Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Database Storage & Querying	PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Visualization	Power BI
Presentation	Gamma App
Version Control	Git & GitHub
🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading & EDA (Python)

Load dataset using Pandas

Explore structure, data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics

Understand customer demographics and purchasing trends

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Modeling (Python)

Handle missing / duplicate values

Encode and transform categorical features

Feature engineering for deeper insights (e.g., CLV, repeat customer indicator)

3️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Create database and tables

Insert cleaned data

Run analytical SQL queries to extract insights such as:

Top-selling categories

High-value vs. low-value customers

Repeat purchase patterns

Impact of discounts / reviews on revenue

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

KPI cards (Revenue, Average Purchase, Total Customers, Repeat Rate)

Revenue & Sales by Category, Gender, Age Group, Channel

Customer Segmentation & Purchase Drivers

Fully interactive dashboard with slicers and custom visuals

5️⃣ Reports & Presentation

PDF report summarizing insights and business recommendations

PPT generated using Gamma to present:

Business problem

Visual insights

Actionable strategies for marketing, retention, and sales growth

📌 Results & Insights (Sample)

🔹 Middle-aged customers contribute the highest revenue
🔹 Discounts & reviews strongly influence purchase decisions
🔹 Accessories & clothing drive majority of sales
🔹 Subscription & loyalty programs have potential to boost repeat purchases

Final recommendations focus on targeted marketing, optimized product mix, and loyalty-driven engagement.
